        <p>I live in Sook Day-as, Cordova</p>

        <br>
        <p> I'm passionate about clean, minimalist design and love creating simple, effective websites 
            with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        <br>
        <br>
            I'm currently focused on improving my front-end development skills and building 
            a portfolio that reflects my style and creativity.
        <br>
        <br>
            My long-term goal is to work in the tech industry as a designer or developer, 
            crafting digital experiences that feel intuitive and inspiring.
